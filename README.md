# Caesar Cipher

## The Odin Project

Challenge proposed in the Ruby full stack development career path on The Odin Project. Link to the challenge [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher).

Fun, simple project. I didn't event take advantage of Ruby's OOP paradigm. This basically aims at practising Ruby's basic syntax.

### Run this project

Clone this repo / download the main file and run `ruby main.rb`.
